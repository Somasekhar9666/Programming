Custom error handling allows you to define your own exceptions to handle specific scenarios in your program. By creating custom exceptions, you can represent errors in a more descriptive and meaningful way, making your code more readable and easier to debug.

1. What is Custom Error Handling?
Custom error handling involves creating user-defined exceptions in addition to the built-in exceptions provided by a programming language. In Python, custom exceptions are created by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses.





2. Why Use Custom Error Handling?
Custom error handling provides several advantages:
Clarity: It allows you to create exceptions that describe specific error conditions in your program.
Granularity: You can catch specific types of custom exceptions and handle them differently based on their type.
Extensibility: Custom exceptions can carry additional information about the error, making debugging easier.
Separation of Concerns: It allows for a clean separation between regular program logic and error handling.






3. How to Create Custom Exceptions in Python
To create a custom exception, you typically:

Define a new class that inherits from the Exception class.
Optionally, add an __init__ method to initialize custom attributes.
Here’s a simple example:
class CustomError(Exception):
    """A custom exception for specific error scenarios."""
    pass

# Raising a custom exception
try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom error message.")
except CustomError as e:
    print("Caught an error:", e)







4. Adding More Functionality to Custom Exceptions
You can add custom behavior to your exception by overriding the __init__ method or adding other methods to your custom exception class. For instance, you can store additional error details or customize the error message.

class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    """Exception raised for errors in the input age."""

    def __init__(self, age, message="Age must be between 0 and 120"):
        self.age = age
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.age} -> {self.message}"

# Example usage
def set_age(age):
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise InvalidAgeError(age)

try:
    set_age(150)
except InvalidAgeError as e:
    print(e)

In this example:
The custom exception InvalidAgeError has two attributes: age and message.
The __str__ method is overridden to provide a formatted error message.
When the age is outside the valid range, the InvalidAgeError exception is raised.







5. Where to Use try, except, else, finally, and raise
Here’s how you can properly use these blocks in the context of custom error handling:

try Block:
Contains the code that might raise an exception (including custom exceptions).
It starts the exception handling mechanism.
except Block:

Used to catch and handle specific exceptions.
You can catch both built-in and custom exceptions.
Multiple except blocks can be used to handle different exceptions differently.
else Block:

Executes if the code in the try block does not raise any exceptions.
It's often used to perform tasks that should only happen if the try block was successful.
finally Block:

Always executes, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.
Commonly used for cleanup actions (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).
raise Keyword:

Used to manually raise an exception, which can be either built-in or custom.
Can be placed inside the try, else, or even finally block, though it’s most commonly used within try or functions to signal an error condition.










6. Examples of Custom Error Handling in Different Use Cases


a. Validating Input with Custom Exceptions
Suppose you want to validate a user’s age:
class AgeValidationError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for invalid age."""
    pass
def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise AgeValidationError(f"Invalid age: {age}. Age must be between 0 and 120.")
try:
    user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    validate_age(user_age)
    print("Age is valid.")
except AgeValidationError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
AgeValidationError is used to handle invalid age values.
If the user enters an invalid age, the custom exception is raised, and the message is displayed.


b. Handling Custom Exceptions for File Operations
Custom exceptions can make file operations more descriptive:
class FileReadError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when reading a file fails."""
    pass

def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            return content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileReadError(f"File '{file_path}' was not found.")
    except IOError:
        raise FileReadError(f"An error occurred while reading the file '{file_path}'.")
try:
    data = read_file("non_existent_file.txt")
    print(data)
except FileReadError as e:
    print("Custom Error:", e)
FileReadError is used to raise a custom exception when file operations fail.
This separates file handling errors from other types of exceptions.


c. Using raise in the finally Block
While unusual, you can raise an exception in the finally block to re-throw an exception or to raise a different one.
class NetworkError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for network-related issues."""
    pass

try:
    print("Attempting to connect to the server...")
    # Simulate a network error
    raise NetworkError("Unable to connect to the server.")
except NetworkError as e:
    print("Caught an error:", e)
finally:
    # Re-raising the same exception
    print("Cleaning up resources...")
    raise












7. Best Practices for Custom Error Handling
Inherit from the Base Exception Class

Always inherit from the built-in Exception class. It ensures that your custom exception is treated as a valid exception type.
Provide Meaningful Names

Name your custom exceptions clearly to indicate the type of error. For example, DatabaseConnectionError, InvalidConfigurationError, etc.
Use try-except Sparingly

Use exception handling only when you expect an error. Avoid using it as a substitute for regular conditional checks.
Avoid Catching All Exceptions with a General except Block

Catching all exceptions (except:) is not a good practice because it can catch unintended exceptions. Always specify the exception type.
Add Useful Attributes to Custom Exceptions

If a custom exception requires additional information (e.g., error code, additional context), store them as attributes in the exception class.
Log Exceptions

Log exceptions whenever necessary, especially in production code, to track issues.
Re-Raise Exceptions When Needed

Sometimes, after handling an exception, you may want to re-raise it to let higher-level code handle it.
try:
    # Some code that might fail
    raise ValueError("An example error")
except ValueError as e:
    print("Handling the error, but re-raising it.")
    raise













8. Comprehensive Example: Custom Error Handling for a Banking Application
Here’s an example of how you can use custom exceptions to handle different errors in a simple banking application:

class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    """Exception raised for attempting to withdraw more than the available balance."""
    pass

class NegativeAmountError(Exception):
    """Exception raised when attempting to deposit or withdraw a negative amount."""
    pass

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            raise NegativeAmountError("Cannot deposit a negative amount.")
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited: {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount < 0:
            raise NegativeAmountError("Cannot withdraw a negative amount.")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise InsufficientFundsError(f"Insufficient funds. Available balance: {self.balance}.")
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrawn: {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}.")

try:
    account = BankAccount(100)
    account.deposit(50)
    account.withdraw(200)
except NegativeAmountError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
except InsufficientFundsError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    print("Transaction complete.")
In this example:
InsufficientFundsError and NegativeAmountError are custom exceptions used to handle specific banking errors.
The deposit and withdraw methods raise appropriate exceptions based on the conditions.
The try-except block handles the exceptions gracefully.
