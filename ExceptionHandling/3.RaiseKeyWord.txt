*Q>is raise keyword should be used in the try block , can not we used in the except block?
The raise keyword can be used anywhere in your code, including within a try block, except block, or even outside these blocks. Each usage serves different purposes depending on the situation.

-------Using raise in Different Blocks-------
1.Using raise in the try Block

When used in the try block, raise is typically used to signal an error condition explicitly.
You might raise an exception manually to indicate that a particular error scenario has occurred.
try:
    value = -10
    if value < 0:
        raise ValueError("Value cannot be negative.")
except ValueError as e:
    print("Caught an exception:", e)
In this example, the raise keyword is used inside the try block to raise a ValueError when the value is negative.



2.Using raise in the except Block
You can use raise in the except block to re-raise an exception that was caught.
This is useful if you want to handle the exception in some way but still let the higher-level code know that the error occurred.
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Handling ZeroDivisionError.")
    raise  # Re-raises the original exception
In this case, the raise statement in the except block re-raises the original ZeroDivisionError after handling it.



3.Raising a New Exception in the except Block
Sometimes, you might want to catch one type of exception and raise a different type of exception.
try:
    # Code that may cause an exception
    file = open("non_existent_file.txt", "r")
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Raising a different exception with a custom message
    raise IOError("Unable to open the specified file.")
Here, FileNotFoundError is caught, and a new IOError is raised with a custom message.

------------------Using raise Outside of try-except Blocks-------------------
The raise keyword can also be used outside of any try-except structure.
This can be useful when defining functions that check for conditions and raise exceptions when those conditions are not met.
def check_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number must be positive.")

# Example usage
check_positive(-5)  # Raises a ValueError outside of a try-except block
--------------------------------------------------









Summary
The raise keyword can be used anywhere in your code, including inside try and except blocks.
When used in the try block, it is typically to signal a specific error.
When used in the except block, it can re-raise the caught exception or raise a different exception.
You can also use raise outside of try-except blocks to perform custom error checking.
The key is to use raise wherever you need to signal an error condition explicitly or propagate an exception further.
